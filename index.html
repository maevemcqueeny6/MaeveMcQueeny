        <p>
                When I was 10 years old sitting I remember sitting in front of the tv scrolling through the channels when I discovered her--My Giaconda. It was Angelina Jolie, in Hackers. Those lips made me linger on the channel, but the storyline made me stay. 
        </p>
                <p>
                Powerful goth kids picking the locks to invisible keys that hold all information. As a nosy younger sibling, I found myself salivating – and not just at Angelina Jolie this time. 
            </p>
                
                <p>I aspired to this level of resourcefulness, adroitness, and sedentariness. 
                </p>
                <p>But, alas, I was a 10 year old kid in the suburbs. And my parents didn't allow much internet play time. 
                </p>
                <p>I learned other things, other codes – the histories of different cultures and peoples. If I could not be Angelina Jolie in Hackers, I would resign myself to becoming Nicholas Cage in National Treasure. I learned a different hacker language, Russian, and double majored in History and Russian Literature and Language. I thought that would be enough. I would never pull back the curtain on computer programming (which would probably just reveal a zillion whizzing servers). 
                </p>
                <p>Out of college, I put my study of language to use at a public relations firm. I was able to apply my creativity by writing and creating video segments. However, after a while, my tasks lacked a certain element of problem-solving, and my natural curiosity began to wander. 
                </p>
                <p>I tried to supplement this curiosity in my private life, teaching myself Adobe Creative Suite, the principles of design, and front end web development. But I needed more. 
                </p>
                <p>That’s when I decided to enroll in a full stack web development program through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
                </p>
                <p>Here, I learned full stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, C#, ASP.Net, and more.</p>
                <p>But those are just the technical skills. This course was also a bootcamp in soft skills. I poured over books to supplement what Angelina Jolie taught me all those years ago. I learned that half a byte is a nibble, I got lost at trying to learn circuits, and I about the copyleft in open source licensing.</p>
                <p>From my classmates I learned the culture – with humble respect and humility, keeping in mind that the expert at anything was once a beginner. The look of shock on my classmates faces when I told them I had never seen any of the Star Wars franchise. I will live with that shame all my life. </p>
                <p>Already I've achieved my goals and more, for every day is more challenging and rewarding than the last.</p>
