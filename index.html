        <h3 class="TLDR">About Me</h3>
        <p>
                Origin story: me, a 10 year old sitting in front of the tv scrolling through the channels when she comes upon Angelina Jolie, in Hackers. Those lips made me linger on the channel, but the storyline made me stay. 
        </p>
                <p>
                Powerful, slightly goth young kids picking the locks to invisible keys that hold all information. As a nosy younger sibling, I found myself salivating – and not just at Angelina Jolie this time. 
            </p>
                
                <p>I aspired to this level of resourcefulness, adroitness, and sedentariness. 
                </p>
                <p>But, alas, I was a 10 year old kid in the suburbs. And my parents didn't allow much internet play time. 
                </p>
                <p>I learned other things, other codes – the histories of different cultures and peoples. If I could not be Angelina Jolie in Hackers, I would resign myself to becoming Nicholas Cage in National Treasure. I learned a different hacker language, Russian, and double majored in History and Russian Literature and Language. I thought that would be enough. I would never pull back the curtain on computer programming (which would probably just reveal a zillion whizzing servers). 
                </p>
                <p>Out of college, I put my study of language to use at a public relations firm. I was able to apply my creativity by writing and creating video segments. However, after a while, my tasks lacked a certain element of problem-solving, and my natural curiosity began to wander. 
                </p>
                <p>I tried to supplement this curiosity in my private life, teaching myself Adobe Creative Suite, the principles of design, and front end web development. But I needed more. 
                </p>
                <p>That’s when I decided to enroll in a full stack web development program through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
                </p>
                <p>If you would prefer a more mystic narrative, here is an alternative arc: 
                </p>
                <p>But then, one night as i lay dreaming--Angelina Jolie came to me in a vision, draped in an ethereal white, whispering words of wisdom. All though she never said anything with her lips, I seemed to know what she wanted from me. From some deep, long-silenced inner voice, I heard: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall hack the planet.” (If you haven't seen hackers, that is one of the big quotes).
